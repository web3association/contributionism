  adoption of Contributionism

# Roadmap

The following is a priority ordered list of roadmap tasks. Overall the plan is to improve the economic model and then look at what tools and processes could be created and used in different experiments.



## **1. Get feedback**

The economic model will benefit from as much feedback as possible from people that have different expertise and opinions.



## **2. Update economic model**

Applying any feedback and continued research and analysis, the economic model will then be improved where necessary. Further efforts can be made around exploring the different approaches that could be adopted for handling important areas such as evaluating or reflecting on contributions.



## **3. Improve data models**

The data models can be improved to include more of the approaches and parameters that organisations might use when operating a contributionist organisation. More scenarios can be covered to see how the model might need to respond to those situations. Currently the data models need to highlight how incentives could be awarded to people for staying longer in an organisation and how to handle contribution outcome percentages that highlight what percentage of the current outcome is each person responsible for.



## 4. Suggest processes and tools to develop

Processes and tools could be created to help organisations with adopting contributionist principles in their organisation.



## 5. Start organisation experiments

The economic model and any tools and processes that have been created can be applied to organisations that are looking to experiment with contributionism. The data and experience from these experiments will be highly valuable for identifying areas for improvement. Existing cooperatives, new organisations and projects building in Web3 ecosystems are all potential candidates for experimentation.
