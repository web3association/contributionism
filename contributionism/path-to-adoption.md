# Path to adoption

Contributionism can be adopted in existing economies across the world today. Markets, different forms of money and existing governments could all stay the same whilst contributionism is being adopted. Contributionism could also be adopted in changing economies where there are different approaches to economic exchange, new forms of money and different forms of government.

Contributionism is solely focussed on the organisation which includes how it is owned, governed and incentivised. Contributionism has an influence on how people collaborate and work together. The key focus area for adoption would be around existing and new organisations that can experiment with contributionist principles. This would lead to more data and learnings that should be informative for any future iterations and improvements to the model or for any of the tools or processes that get created.



## Creating tools & processes

As the economic model continues to mature a number of approaches should become more apparent that are most suitable for creating contributionist organisations. Tools and processes can then be developed that apply these approaches that help with the operation of a contributionist organisation.

Once the economic model has had enough feedback and improvement the next phase of this economic initiative will include any efforts around the creation of tools and processes that make it easier to experiment with the principles and approaches that have been defined in the model.



## **Existing cooperatives**

Cooperatives are already a good example of an existing organisational structure that can often be adopting contributionist principles. These organisations often ensure that all of its members have ownership in the organisation. These organisations can often lean towards being more cooperative than competitive. Existing cooperatives may be interested in experimenting with new tools and processes such as the recording and verification of contributions so that contributors can start to build up a reputation that they could use and benefit from for their entire career.



## New organisations

New organisations could be a great starting point for experimenting with contributionist principles. Organisations that want to be more competitive could adopt some of the ideas and approaches for evaluating and reflecting on contributions that get suggested in the future. Smaller organisations would provide a great environment for finding out what works and what doesnâ€™t in practice.



## **Web3 ecosystems**

Web3 ecosystems are a highly suitable environment for adopting contributionist principles. Many of these ecosystems have the intention to replace many of the existing systems that we use today with systems that push more power to the edges.

Contributionism could be adopted at the smart contract platform layer within ecosystem treasuries and funding processes. It could also be adopted by organisations that are building on top of these networks.

Web3 could represent a high growth area for the adoption of contributionism.
