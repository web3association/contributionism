# Contribution & community based ownership

**Principle**

Organisations should be socially owned by contributors or communities.



**Ownership in contributionism**

Contributionism advocates for social ownership. For organisations this could commonly include contribution based ownership or community ownership. Contributors should have ownership over their contributions in any of these social ownership structures. Permanent records of contribution can help with ensuring that contributors will receive the full benefit of their contributions. Every contribution should receive a fair reward based on the value of the contribution. Organisations need to self determine which contributors are the most suitable for handling the governance of the organisation to decide which contributors should own the organisation. Alternatively the organisation could benefit from being owned and governed by the wider community.



**Contribution based ownership**

Contribution based ownership means that contributions would be used to determine who has ownership in an organisation and who will receive governance rights for those contributions. Contributor ownership approaches include labour, consumption, donation and mixed contributions. Organisations could decide to become a type of worker, consumer or donator based cooperative however a formal structure is not required for organisations to operate under contributionist principles. Each of these types of contribution can be suitable as an approach for determining ownership as they are often required over the long term for the organisation to succeed:

* **Labour** - Labour is a contribution that will nearly always be required to create, maintain and operate an organisation over the long term. Therefore workers are naturally a default suggestion for how many organisations could be owned and governed. Workers should usually be the most well informed people about exactly how an organisation operates and how it could be operated effectively in the future. The experience and knowledge gained by contributing labour towards an organisation can result in workers being a highly suitable group of individuals for owning and governing the organisation that they are responsible for.
* **Consumption** - Consumption is often a necessary long term contribution for an organisation to survive over the long term. Consumers that pay for products and services could also be suitable as the owners of an organisation. Web3 ecosystems are a good example of consumer based ownership where the common intent of these networks is to be owned and governed by the people that use them.
* **Donations** - Donations can be a necessary long term contribution for organisations such as not-for-profits and charities that don’t rely on the sale of products and services. Donators that pay for the operational costs of an organisation could be suitable as owners of those organisations. A group of people may come together to donate their capital to a charity that could help with benefiting the local community. In these situations the donors might prefer to have ownership over the organisation and that their donations become the contribution that influences how the organisation is owned and governed.
* **Mixed contribution ownership** - Some organisations might benefit from having a structure that gives multiple contributions ownership and governance rights in the organisation. The main complexities to consider when taking a mixed ownership approach is that there would be different types of contributions that now impact ownership. This raises concerns about how the value of these different contribution types are measured as this will influence who has control over the organisation. This ownership approach would likely be more complex however this might still be effective in certain circumstances.



**Contributions that are not suitable for ownership**

* **Capital** - Capital is a supplementary contribution. Not every organisation requires capital investments to get started or for it to be maintained and operated over the long term. Capital can be highly useful for certain organisations at certain stages of their development. Capital by itself does not create a highly functioning and profitable organisation. Instead, it is the labour that is able to utilise capital effectively that will determine whether the organisation is successful or not. In situations where capital is required, an agreement needs to be made about what the value of that capital is and what a fair and reasonable return on investment should be. Some types of capital don’t need to be invested and can be returned if the organisation fails such as property investments (physical capital) or patents and intellectual property (intellectual capital). If the capital can be returned to the investor they do not need to receive governance rights in the organisation as they are not risking the loss of their capital. Instead the type of governance rights that might be more suitable in those arrangements is that they might be able to govern how the asset can be used or modified if this was necessary. Financial capital investments are suitable for adopting loan structures that can account for the risk of the organisation failing. These loans could give the investor temporary governance rights so they are able to protect their interests. This is warranted as the capital they invest is at risk of being lost entirely if the organisation fails. Financial capital investments could in practice lead to organisations that are governed by capital investors due to the amount of governance rights they receive. However this would be temporary as the governance rights would eventually lapse once the loan is repaid. Voting power for investor governance rights could be proportional to the remaining amount of capital that needs to be repaid.



**Community ownership**

Community ownership means that a certain community would own and influence how an organisation is governed and operated. Members included in the community would need to be defined by certain constraints such as geographical or location based boundaries. Organisations owned by communities can have members that don’t contribute anything to the organisation. Even though some members might not contribute, the organisation could still have an impact on the members daily lives. Natural monopolies and essential services are some common examples of organisations that could benefit from community ownership. As an example, a water provider could be seen as an essential service for people in a geographical bounded area. One member might have access to the service but might not use it due to having their own water sources. This member might not contribute towards the water provider organisation however they could have a right to have access to the water if they needed it. This is one example of where community ownership could be considered for protecting the interests of a community and ensuring they have access to essential services. In market economies, organisations that are owned and operated by its contributors could still lead to market failures. Community ownership could be one solution that is used to try and prevent these failures from happening or to correct them if they occur.



**Common ownership**

Common ownership focuses on how resources or assets can be collectively owned without the pursuit of individual profit. Natural and digital resources could be owned collectively by a group to help prevent the misuse of those resources. Contribution based ownership organisations could be required to seek approval to use resources that are being governed under a common ownership model. Common ownership could be a viable alternative to community ownership where only the specific resources and assets that are of concern for the community are owned by that community. This approach could help with reducing governance complexity by enabling contributors to govern these organisations themselves with limited community intervention.



**Preference of contributor based ownership**

In general, contributionism advocates for organisations that are owned, governed and operated by those that contribute towards the organisation. Those that commit ongoing contributions towards the operation and success of an organisation are the most likely to be knowledgeable about how the organisation can be effectively operated and governed and also can often be more incentivised to ensure that the organisation is successful over the long term. In a market economy, contributor owned organisations would not be immune to market failures. This problem is why community ownership might be necessary as a complementary approach to prevent and correct these failures.



**Stagnant and unbalanced ownership under capitalism**

Capital based shares in capitalist organisations give the holder permanent ownership in an organisation. These shares often represent perpetual governance and incentive rights. As an organisation gets closer to profitability there is an incentive for existing shareholders to minimise the distribution of any new shares as this would dilute their own ownership in the organisation and reduce the opportunity for maximising future profits for themselves. This incentive creates ownership structures that can become increasingly stagnant and unbalanced over time. Future contributions, regardless of their potential value and impact, can be more easily exploited in this environment due to the incentive of owners to not reward these contributions with shares of ownership that reflect the proportional value that the contribution has generated.
