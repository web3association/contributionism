# Collectively accepted leadership

**Principle**

Leadership should be collectively accepted.



**Collective influence over leadership choices**

If contributions are used as the way to determine who receives governance rights within an organisation the choice of leadership could change over time as the needs and preferences of the organisation and its contributors change. Effective leadership could still remain in their roles for multiple years or even decades. Collective influence should be more useful for situations where there is problematic leadership. Contributors would be able to select other people to fill any leadership positions that exist.



**Emergent leadership**

Not every organisation requires formal leadership positions. Some organisations would prefer a flat operational structure where everyone participates in each decision democratically to influence how an organisation is operated. In these organisations an alternative approach that might be accepted is emergent leadership. Contributors could naturally take initiative and put themselves forward to lead certain tasks and solve certain problems when they have relevant expertise or experience around certain areas. The main outcome that is important is that the other contributors collectively accept this emergent leadership. Contributors that do not like the result of emergent leadership could voice their opinions and concerns. In some cases contributors might suggest the introduction of specific processes and systems to prevent emergent leadership from happening. In other cases contributors might prefer to introduce a formal leadership position with a selection process.



**Democratically elected leadership**

Growing organisations can benefit from leadership roles that delegate certain responsibilities to selected individuals. Leadership roles can help to provide more structure and simplicity in how an organisation makes decisions and operates. It is difficult to expect every contributor in an organisation to be up to date with what is happening across an organisation and be well informed enough to participate in multiple governance decisions across different topic areas. Creating leadership positions with certain responsibilities can be an effective way to handle this complexity of scaling an organisation. In these situations a group of contributors could elect one or multiple contributors that are suitable for this role of handling certain decisions or responsibilities. If the leadership that is selected does not perform well, or the role becomes no longer necessary, the contributors should be able to remove the current leadership and the role entirely through a collective decision process.



**Leadership contracts**

When a leadership role is defined a leadership contract could be used as a document to record the exact parameters and responsibilities of the role. Leadership contracts could be useful for isolating the exact responsibilities and authority that a leadership role is given and the constraints and duration of the contract. Startup organisations might decide to use leadership contracts so that the founders have long term influence over executing the vision they are trying to achieve. The benefit of leadership contracts is that workers would be able to see the exact scope and parameters of the contract and when that contract will lapse. This makes it easier for them to make informed decisions about which organisations they want to contribute towards based on any existing leadership contracts and any other working environment factors. Leadership contracts are also separate from incentive rights. Workers that contribute labour that is more impactful than people in leadership positions should still be able to receive compensation that reflects the larger value and impact of their contributions. This is an improvement over capital based shares that can give founders and people in leadership positions perpetual governance and incentive rights irregardless of their actual performance. Leadership contracts could be an effective solution for complex organisations where a balance needs to be struck between the efficiency of electing competent people into leadership positions against the need to also ensure that the collective opinions and preferences of those that work in the organisation is also taken into account.



**Stagnant leadership under capitalism**

Under capitalism, those in executive positions are selected by the board of directors. The board of directors is selected by the shareholders of the organisation. This ownership structure means that workers will often have little say in who gets selected to lead an organisation. This can be problematic when a majority of workers disagree with the leadership over certain decisions. If workers need the income more than they dislike the decisions of the leadership there is a higher probability that they will stay in the organisation even though they might not want to. Shareholders have little obligation to listen to and respond to the preferences of workers unless an existing law or regulation already exists that determines what they can or cannot do. Workers may agree with leadership and their decision making at the beginning of an organisation however this can change over time and if this does happen the workers would have little to no authority to change the leadership. Workers may have invested years of their time and effort to then experience a change in priorities from the leadership that leaves them in a situation where they feel the need to leave the organisation that they helped to build up from the beginning. Alternatively they would have to accept the leadership even though the majority of workers might disagree with their decisions. Workers are reliant on shareholders to identify and replace poor leadership in these situations. If leadership is generating a lot of profit for shareholders then there is less of an incentive for owners to change the leadership when the current arrangement is working well for them. Shareholders may decide to ignore these factors such as worker discontent and any disagreements with leadership if the leadership is able to generate a large profit that they are satisfied with. Shareholders are free to keep their shares over the long term rather than sell them. New shares might not be issued due to the organisation already being profitable. Stagnation in ownership changes can result in the same people governing the organisation for a long period of time whilst also not needing to make any more contributions to the organisation.
