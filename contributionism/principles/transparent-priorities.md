# Transparent priorities

**Principle**

Priorities should be transparent so that people can contribute towards organisations that they are aligned with.



**Contribution alignment**

Transparency of priorities is an important part of enabling anyone to match their contributions with organisations that they are aligned with. Increasing alignment within an organisation can help with maintaining higher levels of enthusiasm and morale from those that decide to contribute due to a collective alignment around what they are trying to achieve as a group.



**Collectively agreed priorities**

Contributors should be able to share and vote on what they believe are the most important priorities for an organisation. Members of community owned organisations would collectively decide which priorities were most important for that organisation. Contributors would decide in contribution owned organisations. In both of these scenarios all owning members and contributors would be involved in priority setting decisions.



**Example long term priorities**

Organisations could have a number of different priorities that they decide to adopt. These priorities can influence how they operate on a day to day basis. Determining which priority is the most important to an organisation can be highly beneficial for increasing contribution alignment within the organisation. Collectively agreeing on the most important priorities should be an ongoing process. The choices that are initially made for an organisation could change over time as the contributors learn new things and their preferences adapt and change. Some example long term priorities that an organisation could adopt include:

* **Profit focussed** - Organisations could be focussed on generating maximum profit. An important default outcome in contributionism is that the contributors involved in an organisation would be fairly rewarded for their contributions.
* **Mission focussed** - Some organisations could focus on achieving a certain mission above all else. The reward for labour contributions or capital investments may be limited due to this focus and collective alignment around executing an important mission. Charities and not-for-profit organisations could be examples that might have a sole focus on a specific mission.
* **Environmentally focussed** - Respecting and maintaining the environment and preventing any future harm can be an important priority for organisations that operate more closely with nature. Organisations that create physical products may decide to prioritise environmental concerns over profit to ensure they are environmentally sustainable over the long term.
* **Safety focussed** - The safety of the consumer is an important priority for organisations that create products or services that can put peoples lives in danger. Pharmaceutical products, heavy machinery or airlines can be examples where safety is often an important long term priority.
* **Availability & access focussed** - Prioritising access means that an organisation is trying to ensure that the supply of a product or services is always available to the consumer. Services such as water, electricity, heating or internet are common examples that can benefit from prioritising availability and access due to the importance of these services for the consumer.



**Misaligned motives under capitalism**

Under capitalism the motives and priorities of the capitalist owners do not need to be fully aligned with the workers or transparent to other contributors. Capitalist owners could state that they have certain priorities that are aligned with the values of the workers but their actions and decisions could provide evidence that they have other priorities and motives. For instance, a pharmaceutical company could state its most important priority is consumer safety and that their second most important priority is generating profit. If the pharmaceutical company decided to cut corners to save on costs during the trials of a new drug or vaccine this would help with revealing an ulterior motive and reality that the owners are actually prioritising profit over consumer safety. A lack of collective ownership and involvement in decision making can lead to these situations where a minority makes decisions that the majority might disagree with. These misaligned motives can create a highly demotivating environment for workers. Workers could feel less confident about what the organisation is truly prioritising and what the owners actual motives are. Workers could feel alienated in situations where there preferences and opinions about what should be prioritised in the organisation are ignored and not properly represented. Workers can experience a lack of representation to express their opinions and preferences that could have helped with better aligning their contributions with their values.
