## Ubuntu Contributionism: A Blueprint for Human Prosperity

The book “Ubuntu Contributionism”, by Michael Tellinger, explores the concept of Contributionism as an alternative to the conventional economic and social systems that dominate modern societies. The philosophy outlined in the book is rooted in the ancient African idea of "Ubuntu" which emphasises unity within the community and the belief that an individual's well-being is deeply connected to the well-being of others.

The book proposes a society where money is no longer a driving force, and instead, people contribute their skills, talents, and labour to the community in exchange for access to the resources and services they need. Tellinger argues that this system would eliminate many of the inequalities and injustices caused by capitalism, such as financial slavery and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few.

Tellinger envisions a world where communities are self-sufficient, relying on collaboration and mutual support rather than competition. He describes practical steps for achieving this vision, including the establishment of small towns that operate on Contributionism principles. These communities would focus on local production, sustainable energy, and the equitable distribution of goods and services, making them independent of external economic forces.

Tellinger's ideas extend beyond theory; he has also founded the Ubuntu Liberation Movement and political parties in various countries to promote this system. His approach targets local elections, aiming to implement Contributionism on a small scale as a model for larger societal change.

The book suggests a radical shift in how we can think about economics, politics, and community, challenging the status quo and proposing a new way of living that prioritises collective well-being over individual profit.
