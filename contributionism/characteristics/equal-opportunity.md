# Equal opportunity

**Characteristic**

All contributions would receive equal opportunity to be rewarded fairly based on the value they provide.



**Equal opportunity for contributors within an organisation**

Under contributionism, contributions are invited, measured and fairly rewarded. Labour contributions can be used to determine the long term ownership and governance of an organisation. All contributions made within an organisation would be evaluated to determine what the fair value is for those contributions. This evaluation helps to determine what is fair as an immediate reward for those contributions. The full value and impact of a contribution is often not fully known until later in the organisation's development. Reflection on historical contributions is an ongoing process that helps to identify the contributions that have made impact over multiple years. Giving people that contribute incentive and governance rights means there is a stronger alignment with rewarding people that actually contribute towards an organisation. Each contributor would have some influence in the organisation to initiate and vote on decisions and be fairly rewarded for the contributions they have made.



**Equal opportunity for creating new organisations**

Individuals would also have equal opportunity to start their own organisation and receive the reward from any success of that organisation. New organisations that adopt contributionist principles would result in an environment where any contributor that joins the organisation would be entitled to a fair reward for their contributions.



**Proportionally rewarding contributions as the default**

An economic model that is truly focussed on equal opportunity is one that ensures that all contributions are fairly rewarded. To align the incentives with everyone wanting to make meaningful contributions it is important that all of the people that contribute are proportionally rewarded for the value of their contributions. If performant contributors are always rewarded for their efforts this aligns the incentives for these contributors to continue working in these types of organisations. When contributors are only partially rewarded or not rewarded at all there is an immediate incentive for these contributors to identify other opportunities that would better respect and reward their contribution efforts. Proportional rewards based on the value of peoples contributions is the default suggested incentive structure within a contributionist organisation.



**Alternative contribution reward approaches**

Not every group of contributors will prioritise or value the importance of proportional rewards based on the value of each person's contributions. This approach could be ideal for more competitive and high growth environments however this outcome may not be as important for other contributors within different types of organisation. Some contributors may be more interested in the community aspect or the work life balance aspect of an organisation. Contributors could collectively agree on any incentive arrangement that they prefer when operating their organisation. Under contributionism, the main outcome that should be achieved is that contributions should be fairly respected in a way that is collectively agreed. An organisation will need to determine how they want to ensure that contributions are respected and fairly rewarded.



**Reduction of class inequality**

Contributionism seeks to reduce class inequality by providing truly equal opportunity for all individuals. Contributors should be compensated fairly based on the value of their contributions. Contributionism removes the two class system found in capitalism where contributions are disconnected from incentive rights. Contributionism removes this two tier structure and emphasises the importance of fairly rewarding all contributions. Inequality can still exist within contributionism however this would mostly be achieved due differences in contribution between people and differences in the value and impact that each person's contributions are generating.



**The fallacy of equal opportunity in capitalism**

Under capitalism there is an equal opportunity for people to start a new organisation. There is not an equal opportunity for individuals within an organisation. Workers within an organisation are not entitled to a fair reward based on the value of their contributions. Workers rely on the goodwill of capitalist owners to receive fair compensation. Owners are incentivised to maximise their own profit by minimising the amount they spend on workers. If a worker is unhappy with how an organisation is being operated they will often have little to no influence in making changes to that organisation. The notion of equal opportunity in capitalism is that any worker that disagrees with how an organisation is operated can choose to create their own organisation if they want to. This approach is often highly counterproductive as workers may just want to change a small number of things about how the organisation is operated but they have no voice and ability to initiate and collectively agree with other workers whether this change is mutually agreed and beneficial to the workplace. A number of organisations could also have natural monopolies such as electric, water or gas providers or entrenched digital networks with large amounts of adoption such as online marketplaces and social networks. It is not practical to recreate these organisations due to the high cost and network effects they have. It is also a highly wasteful approach for workers to use a large amount of resources to start a new organisation instead of adopting a pragmatic and fair approach to govern and improve the organisations that already exist. Individuals do not receive equal opportunity within organisations and in practice can also be subjected to the rules and policies of capitalist owners due to the impracticalities of duplicating existing and well established organisations.
