# Market failures

Market economies can encounter various types of market-based failures, but numerous solutions exist that can help with preventing and resolving these issues.



## **Resource allocation and utilisation failures**



**Externalities**

Occurs when a third party is affected by a transaction that they are not involved in, leading to costs (negative externalities) or benefits (positive externalities) that are not reflected in market prices. These gains or losses are imposed on a third party that did not take part in the original market transaction. Some examples include:

* **Positive externalities** - Goods or services that benefit a third party such as less congestion due to more cycling.
* **Negative externalities** - Goods or services that impose a cost on a third party such as cancer from passive smoking.



**Public goods**

Public goods are characterised by being non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Public goods lead to underproduction or non-production because individuals cannot be effectively charged for their use. Some types of public goods include:

* **Pure public goods** - Pure public goods are entirely non-excludable and entirely non-rivalrous. National defence is a common example of a pure public good. The market failure arises because private markets struggle to provide such goods efficiently since it's difficult to exclude non-payers, leading to the free-rider problem as individuals have little incentive to pay for this good or service.
* **Common goods** - Non-excludable but rivalrous. Fisheries are a common-pool resource where overfishing leads to the depletion of the fish population. This represents a "tragedy of the commons" scenario. The market failure occurs because individuals have an incentive to exploit the resource before others do, resulting in overuse and potential collapse of the resource.
* **Club good** - Excludable but non-rivalrous up to a point, as congestion can introduce rivalry. A private park or golf course where access is limited to paying members can become congested if too many members use it simultaneously. The market failure can stem from setting membership or usage fees that fail to account for congestion, reducing the overall enjoyment and quality of the good.
* **Digital goods** - Excludable but entirely non-rivalrous. Can be consumed by one individual without reducing availability for others. May or may not be excludable. Digital goods, like software or digital music, where the cost of production is high, but the cost of additional consumers is low. This can result in pricing and distribution inefficiencies because such goods are easily copied and shared, raising intellectual property concerns and possibly reducing the incentive to create the good or service.



**Merit goods**

Merit goods are goods that are undervalued and under-consumed by individuals, relative to the level that would be socially optimal. They provide positive externalities and benefits that are often not fully appreciated by consumers. Education and healthcare are classic examples, where the market may under-provide these goods because individuals might not recognise their full benefits, leading to under-consumption.



**De-merit goods**

De-merit goods are goods that are overvalued and over-consumed by individuals, often resulting in negative externalities that are not accounted for in the market price. Tobacco and alcohol consumption can lead to social costs, such as healthcare burdens and reduced productivity. The market failure occurs because consumers may underestimate the personal and social harm from consuming the good.



**Factor immobility**

Factor immobility refers to the difficulty in reallocating factors of production, such as labour and capital, to where they are most valued or needed, leading to inefficient resource distribution and unemployment. Structural unemployment is one example that can occur when workers lack the skills needed for new jobs or cannot relocate to areas where jobs are available, leading to persistent unemployment and lower economic output.



## **Market structure and competition issues**



**Monopoly power**

Monopoly power occurs when a single firm or a group of firms has significant control over a market, which often leads to higher prices and reduced output compared to more competitive markets, ultimately diminishing consumer welfare. Market structures that can exhibit such power include monopolies, oligopolies, monopsonies and oligopsonies. Economies of scale can enable a firm to achieve significant cost advantages, increasing efficiency and allowing larger firms to dominate the market, thereby creating entry barriers for smaller competitors. For instance, a monopolistic company might set prices above competitive levels and restrict output and consumer choice, as often seen with utility companies when they lack any regulatory oversight.



**Network effects**

Network effects occur when the value of a product or service increases as more people use it, which can create a strong market position for the first successful adopter and this can lead to market lock-in. Dominance of tech platforms like social media networks can stifle competition and innovation because new entrants struggle to attract users without an existing base.



**Incomplete markets**

Incomplete markets exist when there is no market for some goods or services, thus failing to meet potential demand and leaving beneficial exchanges unmade. One example could be the absence of insurance markets for certain risks, like those related to new technologies. This can lead to inefficiencies and underinvestment.



**Indivisibility**

Indivisibility refers to the inability to scale goods or services without significant cost, often resulting in natural monopolies or inefficient allocation. Public utilities may face challenges due to high fixed costs and indivisibilities, leading to inefficiencies without appropriate regulation.



**Speculation and bubbles**

Speculation can drive asset prices far beyond their intrinsic values, leading to bubbles that can burst and cause market crashes, destabilising the economy. The real estate bubble leading up to the 2008 financial crisis is a prime example, where speculative investments caused a severe economic downturn.



**Dynamic inefficiency**

Dynamic inefficiency occurs when resources are misallocated over time due to inadequate investment or poor capital allocation, hindering long-term growth. Insufficient investment in research and development in a rapidly advancing technological industry can result in lost opportunities and reduced competitiveness.



## **Information and behavioural dynamics**



**Imperfect information**

Imperfect information occurs when parties in an economic transaction have unequal or incomplete knowledge, leading to inefficiencies as decisions are made based on partial or incorrect data. Some examples of imperfect information include:

* **Information deficiencies** - Information deficiencies arise when necessary information is unavailable or insufficient for making informed decisions, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Consumers may purchase low-quality products due to lacking information about product quality. In labour markets, employers might not recognise the full set of skills a candidate possesses, leading to mismatched hiring.
* **Misinformation** - Misinformation involves the distribution of false or misleading information that distorts decision-making processes and market outcomes. Advertising that exaggerates product benefits can lead to consumers making poor purchasing decisions. In financial markets, false information about a company's performance can mislead investors, impacting stock prices.



**Adverse selection**

Adverse selection occurs when there is asymmetric information before a transaction, leading high-risk individuals to be more likely to participate, skewing market outcomes. An example of this could be for insurance markets. Individuals with high health risks are more likely to seek coverage, leading insurers to raise premiums or withdraw from the market, potentially leaving out low-risk individuals. Used car markets also experience adverse selection, where sellers know more about vehicle quality than buyers.



**Incomplete contracts**

Incomplete contracts occur when not all future contingencies can be anticipated and specified, leading to disputes and inefficiencies. An example could be a construction contract that doesn’t specify who bears the cost of unexpected delays. This can result in disagreements and increased project costs. Another example is employment agreements, vague job descriptions might lead to disagreements over duties and performance metrics.



**Moral hazard**

Moral hazard arises when one party takes on risk without bearing the full cost of that risk. For instance, insured individuals might engage in riskier behaviour because they don't bear the full cost of their actions, such as driving recklessly with car insurance. Another example could be financial institutions that take on excessive risks if they expect government bailouts.



**Principal-agent problem**

This occurs when agents (such as employees) have different incentives than principals (such as employers), leading to actions that are not in the principal’s best interest. An example of this could be where a company's managers might prioritise personal goals over collective interests, potentially resulting in inefficient operations or resource misuse. In healthcare, doctors might over-prescribe treatments that are not necessarily in the patients best interests due to being paid by that service.



**Bounded rationality**

Bounded rationality describes the limitations of human cognitive processing, leading to suboptimal decision-making due to incomplete information and processing capabilities. Consumers for instance might stick to familiar brands rather than researching alternatives because of information overload. Another example is investors that rely on heuristics, leading to suboptimal portfolio choices.



**Time Inconsistency**

Time inconsistency arises when the preferences of individuals change over time, leading to decisions that may not align with long-term goals. For example, consumers might overspend on credit due to a preference for immediate gratification, impacting their future financial stability. Another example could be governments that prioritise short-term economic boosts over long-term fiscal sustainability.



**Coordination failures**

Coordination failures occur when economic agents fail to synchronise their actions, leading to inefficient outcomes that individual efforts can't resolve. Businesses may fail to adopt compatible technology standards, slowing industry innovation. Collective efforts to reduce emissions may falter if countries do not act in cooperation.



**Information and incentive compatibility issues**

These issues arise when information discrepancies and misaligned incentives prevent economic agents from acting in a way that is socially or economically optimal. In auctions, bidders may underbid due to fears of overpaying (winner's curse). In employment contracts, poorly aligned incentives might lead workers to underperform.



## **Equity and access challenges**



**Inequality**

Inequality as a market failure arises when the distribution of wealth and resources is uneven, hindering economic efficiency and access to opportunities, which can lead to underutilisation of potential talent and resources. High levels of income inequality can lead to reduced overall consumption, as lower-income individuals have less purchasing power. It can also cause economic instability and limit social mobility, perpetuating poverty cycles.



**Cultural and social barriers**

These barriers can prevent certain groups from accessing markets or opportunities fully, due to biases, discrimination or cultural norms which lead to inefficiencies and a loss of potential economic contributions. An example of this could be gender discrimination in the workforce, which can result in underemployment or misallocation of skilled workers, while cultural biases may prevent minority groups from accessing education or financing. These factors can limit overall economic growth.



**Liquidity constraints**

Liquidity constraints occur when individuals or firms cannot access the necessary capital or cash flow to invest or consume, restricting economic activities and growth. Small businesses may fail or stagnate due to an inability to secure loans, despite having viable projects. Households might defer necessary spending (e.g. for healthcare or education) because of cash shortages, leading to longer-term societal costs.



**Regulatory capture**

Regulatory capture happens when agencies tasked with regulating industries act in favour of those industries, rather than public interest, leading to distortions and inefficiencies. When financial regulators prioritise banking industry interests over systemic stability, it may lead to relaxed regulation and contribute to economic crises. Public utility boards captured by energy companies might set rates that favour the company whilst harming consumers.



**Institutional failures**

Institutional failures occur when formal systems (e.g. legal, governmental) are ineffective or corrupt, undermining market function and eroding trust and economic efficiency. Weak legal systems could lead to property rights uncertainties, discouraging investment. Corrupt bureaucracies might inflate costs for business activities, reducing competitiveness and hindering market entry for new firms.



## **Solutions**



**Market based solutions**

Solutions that are predominantly driven by market forces and private sector initiatives. They leverage economic incentives, competition and innovation to address market failures.

* **Impact investing** - This approach involves investing in companies, organisations or funds with the intention of generating measurable social or environmental impact alongside a financial return, thereby addressing market failures related to funding sustainable initiatives that traditional investors might overlook.
* **Crowdfunding platforms** - These platforms enable entrepreneurs and projects to raise small amounts of capital from large numbers of people, democratising access to funding and overcoming market failures where traditional financial systems are unable or unwilling to provide support to innovative or risky ventures.
* **Dynamic pricing models** - Implementing dynamic pricing strategies that can adjust based on demand and supply conditions, helping to efficiently allocate resources in the case of congested infrastructure or services.
* **Cap-and-trade systems** - Using market-based solutions like cap-and-trade for environmental challenges, which limit overall emissions while allowing for flexible compliance through trading permits.
* **Market design and auction theory** - Markets and auctions can be structured to enhance efficiency and transparency by implementing mechanisms that prevent market abuses and ensure fair competition. This is achieved by designing rules that facilitate open access to information, encourage truthful bidding, and align incentives to allocate resources to those who value them most, thereby optimising market performance.
* **Standards and certifications** - Standards and certification processes are established to ensure the quality and safety of products and services, effectively reducing information asymmetries and boosting consumer confidence. Industry groups often develop voluntary standards and guidelines to fill gaps in existing regulatory frameworks, which can help with enhancing trust and reliability in the marketplace.
* **Blockchain solutions** - Blockchain solutions could help with reducing information asymmetry and inefficiencies and helping to address issues such as fraud, counterfeiting and unethical practices. An example of this could be the application of blockchain to supply chains to enhance transparency, security and traceability of any goods being transported.
* **Technological solutions** - Technological solutions can play a crucial role in addressing market failures by improving existing infrastructure and market systems. For instance, smart grid technology can mitigate energy distribution and environmental impact market failures by enhancing demand responses, using real-time monitoring and by providing a seamless integration of renewable energy sources.
* **Private contracts and agreements** - Private contracts and agreements allow parties to negotiate solutions that address externalities and improve resource allocation efficiency. The utilisation of legal frameworks can help with tackling market failures without requiring government intervention. The Coase Theorem suggests that, if property rights are clearly defined and transaction costs are negligible, parties can negotiate to resolve externalities efficiently; however, real-world frictions often impede such negotiations. Pollution from a factory could harm nearby residents, yet resolving this without clear property rights or low transaction costs often requires regulatory intervention. Noise pollution disputes between neighbours are sometimes not resolved through negotiation due to high transaction costs or emotional factors.
* **Corporate social responsibility (CSR)** - Encouraging businesses to voluntarily adopt practices that go beyond profit-making to include social and environmental sustainability.
* **Rating agencies** - Rating agencies provide independent assessments of creditworthiness, helping to reduce information asymmetry in financial markets. By offering standardised evaluations, they enhance market transparency and efficiency, enabling investors to make more informed decisions.
* **Joint ventures** - Strategic partnerships between companies to collaborate on specific projects or markets enable resource sharing and risk mitigation, fostering innovation and overcoming barriers to entry.



**Government based solutions**

Solutions that rely on government action, regulation and policy to correct market failures.

* **Public goods provision** - Governments provide or fund public goods, such as national defence, education, public parks, infrastructure and public health services, which can be typically under provided by the market due to their non-excludable and non-rivalrous nature.
* **Taxation & subsidies -** Using taxes and subsidies to align private incentives with social welfare. For instance, taxing activities that produce negative externalities (like pollution) and subsidising activities that yield positive externalities (like education).
* **Progressive taxation -** Implementing progressive taxes, where higher income brackets are taxed at higher rates, can help with addressing economic inequality by redistributing wealth more equitably.
* **Minimum wage laws** - By implementing a legal minimum wage, governments aim to protect workers from exploitation and reduce income inequality. This policy helps with market failures in labour markets by ensuring that workers receive better compensation which can help with improving overall economic equity.
* **Social insurance and redistribution -** Developing social insurance programs and redistributive policies that help to address inequality and provide a safety net for individuals, mitigating the risks associated with unemployment, illness or old age.
* **Incentive alignment** - Incentive alignment involves designing policies that align private interests with social goals, using tools like performance-based payments in public procurement and tax incentives or subsidies to encourage beneficial activities.
* **Price controls -** Implementing temporary price floors or ceilings to manage situations where certain goods are too expensive or too cheap due to market failures. These can often be used sparingly due to potential distortions.
* **Regulation and legislation** - Governments impose regulations and safety standards to protect public interests, mitigate negative externalities and ensure safe and fair practices. Regulation and legislation can help with correcting market failures that occur due to inadequate information or private incentives.
* **Antitrust laws** - A type of law that can help with preventing anti-competitive behaviour and promoting market competition by prohibiting monopolistic practices. This can help to ensure that consumers benefit from fair pricing, innovation and choice.
* **Tailored policy design -** Developing context-specific policies that are tailored to the unique needs and circumstances of each country, rather than relying on generic, one-size-fits-all solutions.
* **Zoning regulations** - Governments use zoning laws to control land use, manage urban development and mitigate negative externalities like congestion and pollution, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently.
* **Urban planning & infrastructure development** - Through strategic planning and infrastructure investments, governments can try to optimise the use of space, reduce congestion and support economic development, correcting market failures related to public goods and externalities.
* **Financial market interventions** - Interventions such as regulating financial institutions and providing deposit insurance aim to maintain stability and trust in financial markets, addressing issues like asymmetric information and systemic risk.
* **Resource quotas** - Quotas limit the use of common resources, such as fishery catch limits, to prevent over-exploitation and ensure sustainable management, addressing the tragedy of the commons.
* **Cost-benefit analysis** - Governments can use cost-benefit analysis to help with evaluating the economic efficiency of projects and policies, ensuring that public resources are allocated toward interventions that maximise social welfare.
* **Property rights -** Clearly defining and enforcing property rights to prevent overuse or misuse of resources, such as common resources that suffer from the tragedy of the commons.
* **Patent and copyright laws** - Intellectual property laws incentivise innovation and creativity by granting temporary monopolies, allowing creators to recoup their investment, yet this must be balanced to prevent market distortions.
* **Strengthening institutions -** Building and reinforcing institutions that support market function, such as legal systems, property rights and financial regulation bodies, to better provide stability and trust.
* **Regulatory sandbox** - Creating a regulatory sandbox where new business models can operate under relaxed regulations to innovate and address potential market failures without excessive bureaucratic constraints.
* **Behavioural nudges -** Designing policies that use insights from behavioural economics to gently steer people towards making choices that lead to better market outcomes without restricting freedom of choice.
* **Corruption mitigation -** Introducing measures to reduce corruption risks, such as increasing transparency, accountability and monitoring within government agencies as well as ensuring that regulatory bodies are independent and well-governed.
* **Tort lawsuits** - Tort lawsuits can help with internalising negative externalities by holding parties accountable for the harm they cause to others. By imposing legal costs on harmful behaviour, tort law incentivises individuals and businesses to take adequate precautions to prevent harm, aligning private incentives with social welfare.



**Collective and community based solutions**

Solutions that depend on collective action, community involvement and partnerships.

* **Cooperative models** - Cooperatives are member-owned organisations that operate for the mutual benefit of their members, addressing market failures by fostering equitable access to goods, services and profits. Cooperatives can help with improving community welfare and reducing market power imbalances.
* **Collaborative consumption models** - Promoting sharing economies and collaborative consumption models that maximise the utilisation of resources and reduce negative externalities through shared access to goods and services.
* **Public-private partnerships (PPPs)** - Partnerships between the government and private sector to design, finance and deliver public services or infrastructure projects by leveraging the strengths of both sectors.
* **Collective bargaining** - Through collective bargaining, workers negotiate with employers as a unified group to secure fair wages, benefits and better working conditions. This can help with mitigating power imbalances in labour markets that could be causing lower living standards.
* **Community land trusts** - These are nonprofit organisations that hold land on behalf of a community to ensure long-term affordability and sustainable development, addressing market failures related to housing and land use.
* **Peer-to-peer platforms** - Platforms that facilitate direct exchanges between individuals, such as ride-sharing or home-sharing services, improve market efficiency by utilising underused assets and creating new economic opportunities.
* **Environmental stewardship programs** - Community-led initiatives that promote conservation and sustainable management of natural resources foster collective action to address ecological market failures, enhancing local environmental outcomes.
* **Open source platforms** - These platforms allow collaborative development and sharing of technology and software, reducing barriers to innovation and addressing market failures related to proprietary access and cost.
* **Industry consortia** - Groups of companies within an industry collaborate to set standards, share research and drive innovation, helping to address market failures through collective expertise and resources.
* **Social norms and networks** - Informal systems of shared values and behaviours within a community can influence individuals to act in socially beneficial ways, overcoming market failures related to public goods and externalities.
* **Non-profit and charitable efforts** - Encouraging non-profit organisations to address areas where markets fail to provide adequate services or goods, often through donations and volunteer work.
* **Innovation and research funding** - Government or private funding of research and development to overcome market undersupply in areas where private sector investment is insufficient due to high risk or long time horizons.
* **Public lending and microfinance** - Providing access to credit for underserved populations to overcome market failures in credit markets, promoting entrepreneurship and economic development.
* **Social entrepreneurship support** - Encouraging and supporting social enterprises that aim to solve social problems through market-based solutions, combining philanthropic goals with commercial strategies.



**Educational and informational solutions**

Initiatives focused on changing behaviour through education, information dissemination and awareness-raising.

* **Education and awareness campaigns** - Increasing public awareness about products or activities that have negative externalities such as health or environmental implications, helping to change consumer behaviour and reduce market failures.
* **Consumer advocacy** - Organisations and movements that represent consumer interests work to ensure fair treatment and transparency, addressing market failures related to deceptive practices and information gaps.
* **Consumer protection agencies** - Creating agencies to protect consumers from misinformation and ensure fair practices.
* **Online educational platforms** - These platforms provide accessible learning resources for diverse subjects, democratising education and helping mitigate knowledge disparities that contribute to market inefficiencies.
* **Market-driven information platforms** - Platforms that provide real-time data and insights, such as price comparison websites or financial analytics tools can help with empowering consumers and businesses to make informed decisions, reducing asymmetric information.
* **Ethical labelling** - Labels indicating ethical practices, like being cruelty-free, to better inform consumers about product attributes, allowing them to make value-driven purchases and to promote more socially responsible market behaviour.
* **Financial literacy programs** - These programs equip individuals with knowledge and skills to make informed financial decisions, reducing market failures associated with asymmetric information and poor financial planning.
* **Decentralisation and local governance** - Empowering local governments to address public good provision and market failures more efficiently through localised knowledge and implementation strategies.
* **Provision of information** - Ensuring transparency and availability of information to consumers and businesses to address asymmetric information issues and improve decision-making.
* **Improving information dissemination** - Establishing systems and regulations to ensure better information flow and transparency in markets, which can mitigate problems associated with information asymmetries.
