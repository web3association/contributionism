# Complimentary models

There are a number of complementary economic models and approaches that suggest new solutions for managing resources and the handling of the means of production. Some economic approaches suggest that markets could be replaced with economic planning using governance or technological solutions. Even in the more all encompassing economic models, contributionism could still be widely adopted as the preferred approach to invite, measure and reward contributions within an organisation. A number of alternative economic approaches could gain adoption in certain communities or nations across the world over the coming years and decades.

The adoption of any of these economic models could result in an increasingly mixed global economy for a period of time. Mixed economies could also end up being a transitory phase until one or a handful of economic models succeed against some of the existing approaches. Other economic approaches could also represent a balancing force for market based approaches, where these other approaches could provide long term solutions that are more efficient or effective in certain areas such as for social safety nets, supporting public goods and addressing inequalities or market failures.

Many of the economic models mentioned below can overlap with one another in how they would handle things like governance, economic exchange, planning, technology and general social wellbeing.



**Resource-based economy**

A resource-based economy is a system where goods and services are distributed based on the availability and sustainability of resources rather than through markets, monetary systems or direct trade. The allocation of resources is managed scientifically and efficiently to ensure that all members of society have their basic needs met. This model emphasises technological solutions to production and distribution challenges, aiming for a sustainable and balanced use of natural resources. Some key characteristics include:

* **No money or markets** - Resources are allocated without the use of money or market mechanisms. Instead, decisions are based on resource availability and need.
* **Sustainability** - The system focuses on managing natural resources in a way that is sustainable for both people and the planet.
* **Technological management** - Advanced technology is used to optimise production and distribution, ensuring efficiency and minimal waste.
* **Need-based distribution** - Goods and services are provided based on need rather than ability to pay or exchange.
* **Global approach** - Typically aims for a global rather than local approach to resource allocation, ensuring that resources are shared across society based on collective goals.



**Cybernetic economy**

A cybernetic economy is a system where computers, algorithms and advanced data management tools play a central role in managing the economy, including the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services. Rather than relying on markets or human planners, economic decisions are made through automated systems based on real-time data inputs. Cybernetic economies are highly dependent on technology and aim to optimise resource use, production efficiency and distribution in a decentralised or centralised manner. Some key characteristics include:

* **Automation** - Computers and algorithms manage the economy, often in real time, using vast amounts of data.
* **Data-driven decision-making** - Economic decisions are based on data inputs such as resource availability, production efficiency and consumption patterns.
* **Decentralisation & centralisation** - Can be centrally controlled or decentralised, depending on the design of the cybernetic system.
* **Efficiency focus -** Aims to maximise efficiency in resource allocation and production by reducing human error and inefficiencies.
* **Technological dependence -** Relies on advanced technology, artificial intelligence and automation to replace or support human decision-making.



**Commons-based economy**

A commons-based economy is a system in which resources are collectively owned or managed by a community and shared among its members according to agreed-upon rules or norms. The "commons" refers to resources like land, water, or even digital resources like open-source software that are held in common by a group. These resources are typically governed through democratic processes, ensuring that their use is sustainable and equitable for all members of the community. This model relies on cooperation, collective responsibility and long-term resource management. Some key characteristics include:

* **Collective ownership** - Resources are owned and managed collectively, rather than by private individuals or the state.
* **Democratic governance** - Decisions about resource use and distribution are made collectively, often through participatory or democratic processes.
* **Sustainability** - Emphasises sustainable management of shared resources to ensure long-term use for the community.
* **Social norms** - Sharing and managing resources often rely on social norms and rules that are designed and enforced by the community.
* **Diverse resources** - Commons can include both physical resources (e.g. land, forests or fisheries) and digital and intellectual resources (e.g. open-source projects or Wikipedia).



**Post-scarcity economy**

A post-scarcity economy is a theoretical system in which resources, goods and services are so abundant that they are no longer scarce. Technological advances, such as automation, artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing such as 3D printing are thought to make the production of goods so efficient that nearly everything is available at little or no cost. In a true post-scarcity economy, the concept of pricing, money and trade would largely become irrelevant because goods are plentiful and people's basic needs are met automatically. Some key characteristics include:

* **Abundance of resources** - Advanced technology enables the production of goods and services in such quantities that scarcity is virtually eliminated.
* **Minimal or no prices** - With abundant resources, goods are provided freely and pricing becomes irrelevant for many essential and non-essential goods.
* **Automation and AI** - Automation and artificial intelligence handle most production and decision-making, minimising the need for human labour.
* **Needs-based distribution** - Goods and services are distributed based on need, rather than ability to pay or market demand.
* **Focus on quality of life** - The system emphasises meeting basic needs, such as food, shelter, healthcare and education, allowing people to focus on personal fulfilment, creativity and leisure.



**Other economic models**

A number of other economic models could be adopted in parallel to contributionism. Contributionism focuses on how organisations are owned, governed and incentivised rather than how goods and services should be exchanged and how a nation state should be governed. Examples of other economic models include subsistence, mutualism, communalism, Autarky (self-sufficiency), solidarity and steady-state economies. These are just examples and this list is not exhaustive. These other economic models could be mostly or entirely compatible with contributionist principles and ideas. As contributionism is solely focused on the organisation it is highly versatile and flexible in where it could be adopted.
