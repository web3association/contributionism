# Governments

Nation state governments are responsible for establishing and enforcing laws, managing public resources and providing services such as education, healthcare and defence to ensure the welfare and security of its citizens. Governments also will often engage in diplomatic activities and negotiate with other governments to maintain international relations and address global challenges. Governments can range from being very small to very large in terms of responsibilities and scale depending on the preferences and needs of a nation. Organisations that adopt contributionist principles would need to comply with local laws and regulations in any of the nations they are operating in. Contributionism could be adopted across a variety of economies that each could be using different approaches for their government.



## Government responsibilities

Nation state governments could be responsible for handling a range of services depending on the size of the government and preferences and needs of the nation. Some responsibilities could include national security and defence, law and order, public goods, public infrastructure, public education, public healthcare, social welfare, foreign relations, environmental regulations, crises management and taxation and revenue collection.

Governments are also often responsible for economic management which involves the creation of policies that help with promoting growth and stability whilst also managing inflation, unemployment and taxation.

Many nation states manage their own national currency through a central bank. This responsibility could be challenged over the coming years and decades as cryptocurrencies continue to improve and offer people decentralised alternatives.

As part of managing public goods and resources, local community governments and nation state governments could also be responsible for determining who will be affected by certain decisions. Those that are affected by certain decisions can then be included in the governance process to influence how those goods and resources get managed and used.



## **Government approaches**

The size and responsibilities of a nation state government will vary depending on the needs and preferences of each nation. The following approaches help to highlight some examples of governments that range from small to large in terms of their responsibilities. Any of the following approaches could be adopted in a contributionist society. This list is not exhaustive, there are many approaches that could be adopted within each nation state government.



**Classic liberal government**

A classic liberal government emphasises individual freedoms, limited government intervention, and the protection of civil liberties. The role of the state is primarily to ensure the protection of individual rights, such as property rights, freedom of speech and the right to participate in free markets. Economic activity is largely driven by businesses. Government regulation is kept to a minimum. Some key characteristics include:

* **Minimal government intervention** - The government plays a limited role in economic and social affairs, emphasising free markets, competition and individual choice.
* **Protection of individual rights** - The governmentâ€™s primary role is to protect civil liberties and political rights, such as freedom of speech, religion and assembly.
* **Free markets** - Classic liberal governments favour laissez-faire economic policies, where the private sector drives economic activity with minimal state intervention.
* **Rule of law** - There is a strong emphasis on the rule of law, ensuring that individuals are protected from government overreach or arbitrary decisions.



**Regulated government**

A regulated government maintains a balance between free markets and government intervention to correct market failures and protect the public interest. The state intervenes to regulate industries, protect consumers and ensure that economic competition remains fair. While there is still room for private enterprise and free markets, the government has a more active role in ensuring that businesses do not exploit consumers, workers or the environment. Some key characteristics include:

* **Active regulation of markets** - The government implements regulations to prevent monopolies, protect consumers, ensure labour rights and address environmental concerns.
* **Balance of freedom and oversight** - While private enterprise and free markets are central, the government enforces rules to maintain fairness, safety and sustainability in the economy.
* **Correcting market failures** - The government intervenes to address issues like externalities (e.g. pollution), public goods provision (e.g. infrastructure) and information asymmetries (e.g. consumer protection).
* **Regulatory agencies** - The government creates and maintains regulatory bodies to oversee sectors like finance, health, labour and the environment.



**Social government**

A social government (also called a welfare state) takes a more active role in ensuring social welfare and economic equality, providing extensive public services such as healthcare, education, housing and social security. Social governments are characterised by their emphasis on reducing inequality through redistributive policies, progressive taxation and strong welfare systems. While they still allow for market economies, they place greater importance on public goods and social safety nets. Some key characteristics include:

* **Strong welfare state** - The government provides extensive social programs, including universal healthcare, education, unemployment benefits and pensions to ensure the basic needs of citizens are met.
* **Redistributive policies** - The government uses progressive taxation and other policies to reduce income inequality and redistribute wealth.
* **Government ownership or involvement in key sectors -** In some cases, social governments may control or heavily regulate industries like healthcare, utilities and education to ensure accessibility and fairness.
* **Emphasis on equality and social justice** - Social governments prioritise reducing disparities in wealth, access to services and opportunities, aiming to create a more equitable society.



**State government**

A state government refers to a system where the state plays a significant role in managing key aspects of the economy, including the ownership and operation of major industries, provision of public goods and regulation of resources. Unlike purely centralised or autonomous operations in other systems, state governments can vary in their structure, emphasising a range of control from centralised planning to allowing some degree of public participation, depending on the political environment and governance goals. Some key characteristics include:

* **State ownership and management** - Major industries and resources, such as healthcare, energy and transportation, are owned and managed by the state. Control may be centralised or involve various degrees of public and worker participation in governance, depending on the state's approach to economic management.
* **Provision of public goods** - The state is responsible for ensuring the availability and accessibility of essential services and public goods, including education, healthcare and infrastructure.
* **Regulation and oversight** - The state implements and enforces regulations to manage resources effectively, maintain social welfare and ensure economic stability and fairness.
* **Social cohesion and equality** - State governments often prioritise policies that promote social justice and equality, aiming to distribute wealth and resources fairly to reduce disparities.
* **Accountability and checks** - Systems of accountability, such as regulatory bodies, oversight mechanisms and sometimes public participation, are implemented to ensure that the state's power is not misused and remains aligned with the citizens' needs and values.



## Central vs democratic economic planning

Economic planning means the government would determine what goods and services to produce, how to produce them and how to distribute them. More economic planning would result in a larger amount of publicly owned organisations. These organisations could still adopt contributionist principles.

In a market economy, a classical liberal government would mostly or entirely leave the responsibility of determining which goods and services should get produced to the market. A planned economy represents an alternative approach where all economic decision-making is handled by the government. This would mean that market exchange, driven by consumer choice and competition, would be replaced by government directives and plans that are designed to meet specific economic and social objectives. Mixed economies can combine elements of both market economies and economic planning. Economic planning would be relevant to the regulated, social or state based government approach examples.



**Central planning**

In a centrally planned system, the people that work within the government would be responsible for making key economic decisions, including what goods and services to produce, how to produce them and how to distribute them. This system is most commonly associated with command economies. This approach has the issue that it would mean reducing the amount of direct representation and involvement that people can have in the decisions that impact their daily lives. In contributionism, leadership contracts are suggested as an optional solution for handling governance in organisations. Any responsibilities and control that these leadership positions would be given should be fully justified and accepted collectively. Any government position of influence should also be limited in duration and the scope of responsibilities so that the position cannot be abused and so that new leadership can be selected in the future. Late stage capitalism can result in a small number of actors having a large amount of control and influence over the economy and society. Central economic planning can result in this same outcome, however these actors would instead be in the government. Central planning is therefore less desirable as an approach for handling economic planning. If an economy does decide to use a central planning approach, influential positions should be specifically tailored to the problems that need to be addressed and have a limited duration of influence.



**Democratic planning**

Democratic planning involves collective decision-making processes where citizens, workers and stakeholders actively participate in determining economic policies and resource allocation. It aims to combine planning with democratic governance. Democratic planning is aligned with contributionist principles as it ensures that people's rights and ability to influence their economy are not taken or delegated away. Delegation of voting power in a democratically planned economy would be a choice and not a requirement. Democratic planning can increase the risk of making decision making slower and more complex due to the need to balance diverse interests and try to reach a consensus. However this approach also helps to encourage inclusivity and accountability, ensuring economic decisions reflect the broader community's needs and values. The right systems and processes would be required to effectively facilitate democratic planning. Overall, democratic planning would be the preferred planning approach due to it giving individuals the ability to directly influence the decisions that impact their daily lives.
