  contributionism

# Organisations

Organisations include small businesses, large corporations, charities, small community projects or even local sports clubs. Any person or group of people that comes together for a particular purpose could be considered an organisation that could adopt contributionist principles and approaches.

Three important areas that influence how an organisation is operated include how it is owned, governed and incentivised. Organisations could adopt a variety of approaches within each of these areas under contributionism.
