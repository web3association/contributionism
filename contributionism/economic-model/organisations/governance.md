# Governance

Under contributionism, organisations are either governed by those that contribute towards an organisation or by the wider community that are affected by the organisation. The adopted ownership type determines which community members or contributors will receive governance rights. Each governance right would have a certain amount of voting power. Voting power will determine how much influence someone has in each governance decision.



## Temporary governance rights

The ownership approach will determine who receives governance rights and how those rights are awarded. Most of the ownership types are contribution based which means that people's contributions will play a key role in determining whether they receive governance rights. All contribution based governance rights are temporary and do not last in perpetuity. A contribution needs to be fairly rewarded over the long term based on the value it provides. Governance rights should last long enough to give a contributor influence over how contributions are being rewarded. Governance rights help to protect people's interests in the organisation.



**Labour**

Worker owned organisations would use labour to determine who receives governance rights.

**Consumption**

Consumer owned organisations would use consumer purchases to determine who receives governance rights.



**Donations**

Donator owned organisations would use donations to determine who receives governance rights.



**Capital investments**

Capital investments that are not collateralised could receive governance rights. Investors risk the capital they invest if their capital might not be returned. Financial investments are an example of an uncollateralised investment as organisations could spend the majority or all of the investment before the organisation fails. Giving a capital investor governance rights can help them with protecting their interests so that they have influence over how the organisation operates. More specifically in some cases this might just mean governance rights that cover how the organisation is able to use the capital invested. Organisations with every ownership approach can benefit from capital investment. Capital investors could receive temporary governance rights in every type of organisation.



**Mixed contributions**

Mixed ownership organisations would use a combination of labour, consumption or donation based contributions to determine who receives governance rights.



**Community ownership**

Community owned organisations would give governance rights to all its members. Communities will need to clearly define what factors determine whether someone is or isn’t a member of that community.



## Voting power

Governance rights will give people a certain amount of voting power. Voting power determines how much influence they have in organisation decisions. If contributions are being used for ownership and determining governance rights the two main voting power approaches are one person one vote and proportional contribution value based. One person one vote would translate into determining what threshold of contribution is required for a contributor to receive the same voting power as everyone else receives. The proportional approach is where voting power is distributed based on the value of each person's contributions. Organisations could create a voting power approach that sits somewhere between these two options or that blends them together. Different decisions could use different voting power approaches.



## Labour voting power approaches



**One worker one vote**

Each worker involved in the decision is given equal voting power. A worker would include anyone that is contributing their labour towards an organisation. An organisation may decide to require a certain threshold of contribution such as the contributor should be working full time or that they have contributed for a minimum period of time such as three months before they are eligible to receive their governance rights. A one worker one vote approach could be effective for organisations that want to operate with a more cooperative and simple governance structure. It also might be relevant for situations where there is not a drastic amount of difference in the amount or quality of contributions that each person is making. Contributors that prefer simpler voting structures and more cooperative environments may prefer this approach.



**Labour value based**

Each worker involved in the decision is given voting power that is equal to the value of the labour contributions they have provided. This approach can be effective for organisations where there is a big difference in the amount or quality of the contributions that each person is making or when the environment benefits from a more competitive environment. Contributors may also just prefer this approach if they want a competitive environment where the incentive structures more accurately reward people for performance and impactful contributions by giving them more influence in the organisation.



## Donation voting power approaches



**One donor one vote**

Each person that donates to an organisation would receive equal voting power. The donor might need to reach a certain donation threshold value to receive any voting power.



**Donation value based**

Each person that donates is given proportional voting power based on the value of their donations. The more that someone has donated to an organisation the larger their voting power is.



## Consumption voting power approaches



**One consumer one vote**

Each person involved in the decision is given equal voting power. In a market economy, a consumer would be anyone that has been purchasing the product or service that is offered by the organisation.



**Consumer expenditure based**

Each person is given an amount of voting power that is based on the amount they have spent with the organisation. Consumer expenditure based voting power would mean that the biggest consumers of the product or service would have the most influence in governance decisions.



## **Other voting power approaches**



**One person one vote**

Each person involved in the decision is given equal voting power. A person could include anyone that has been contributing towards an organisation or that will be impacted by a decision. This approach could be suitable for situations where each person voting could be affected by a decision equally. Community owned organisations might adopt this voting approach for a number of decisions.



**Based on the degree in which a decision affects someone**

Each person is given an amount of voting power that reflects the degree in which it affects them. This could mean that a number of people are involved for different reasons due to how one decision could impact a range of people in different ways. As an example, if an organisation wanted to open up a manufacturing facility in a local area the decision to approve the construction of that facility might need approval from the people that will be affected by its construction. The facility might generate pollution or traffic congestion which could impact the lives of others negatively. Sometimes existing regulations and policies can handle these situations by making a defined process that an organisation can follow to seek approval. In other situations where the decision is more complex it might be necessary to involve all of the people that will be affected by the outcome of a decision.



## Combining voting power approaches

The voting power approaches mentioned above could be combined together in a number of ways and weighted differently. For instance an organisation could use a one worker one vote voting power approach and partially combine this with a labour value based approach so that there is at least some increase in voting power for people who have contributed more than others. Alternatively another decision might use a labour value based approach for the majority of the voting power but give everyone a minimum amount of voting power by applying an element of one worker one vote. Another way that these voting power approaches could be combined is in situations where a certain decision could impact people outside of an organisation such as the construction of a new manufacturing facility. In these situations there could be a number of decisions that are handled by the local community. Each decision within an organisation could adopt a different voting power approach or a combination of approaches to more effectively and fairly govern the organisation. An organisation ultimately wants to make good decisions. Those that are relevant or impacted by the decisions will ideally be involved and be able to provide their input during a governance process.



## Stacked voting power

One person one vote voting power approaches could be adopted in a few ways. The simplest approach is that it is always one person one vote for every decision. Another approach is that people's voting power could increase and stack based on the number of years they have participated. For a one worker one vote approach this could mean that a worker that has provided three years of their labour could be given 3 points of voting power instead of just 1 point of voting power. Any of the voting power approaches mentioned above could adopt a system of stacking voting power based on an increased amount of contribution or participation. An organisation might also need to consider applying limits to a stacked approach so that the influence of certain individuals doesn’t become too excessive. For example, labour based voting power could be limited to the most recent five years worth of contribution. This means that contributors that stay with the organisation beyond five years would not receive an ever increasing amount of voting power. Organisations need to self determine whether it makes sense to introduce stacked voting power and what limits should be applied if any.



## Delegated voting power

Someone with governance rights and voting power might decide that they don’t want to vote themselves on certain decisions. This could be due to not having enough time to properly participate, them not having enough context or experience about the decision or just because they would prefer someone else to handle it for them. Systems that enable people to delegate voting power are an important solution within governance systems as there is no way to stop someone from copying the voting choices of another person. By developing systems that can handle this process of delegation it is actually advantageous for the voting process as now it will at least be more clear and transparent when people have decided to delegate their voting power to other people.



## Elected leadership positions

Elected leadership positions are another important approach for scaling governance systems. Someone could be given the responsibility to handle certain decisions once they are elected. This could be useful for situations where there is difficulty in coming to an agreement and a group is satisfied with delegating this responsibility to someone who will handle the decision and potentially also the outcomes that emerge from that decision. Elected representatives can be an effective way to limit the governance complexity that each voter needs to handle in an organisation. Similar structures are often adopted in many organisations that exist today. Founders or managerial positions can often have a large amount of influence over the direction of an organisation. Some organisations may prefer to operate in this manner out of efficiency. The key difference is that the leadership and responsibilities given to them would be due to the result of being elected by the contributors or community that owns the organisation. Leadership contracts could be used to define the parameters, rules and duration of any leadership positions that get introduced.



## **Governance decisions that should include those that are affected**

Regardless of how an organisation might want to be owned and governed there are situations where the people involved in a decision should include those that will be affected by that decision. This could be relevant for situations when an organisation wants to use resources that are scarce and socially owned. For example, a company might want to use local wood by chopping down tree’s in a local forest to create furniture. Local policies and regulations could determine how organisations are able to request and use these resources. If local policies and regulations don’t exist or if they don’t cover the request that the organisation is making a process would be needed to handle this request. Organisations cannot operate with full autonomy when the decisions they make could negatively impact the lives of other people. Democratic governance processes, regulation and policies could be used to help handle these issues. Market failures can still occur under contributionism as the economic model is focussed on how the organisation is owned, governed and incentivised.
