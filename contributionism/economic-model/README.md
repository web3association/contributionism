# Economic model

Contributionism is an economic model that focuses on how organisations are owned, governed and incentivised. Organisations play a large role in influencing how the wider economy functions. Contributionism represents an alternative approach to capitalism.

How goods and services are exchanged, what money is being used and how nation state governments function are all areas of importance when thinking about the wider economy. The principles outlined in contributionism can also be considered when thinking about these other economic areas. For instance, contributionist principles could be particularly relevant for governments which themselves are a type of organisation where people come together to collaborate and make decisions.

Contributionism is flexible and could be adopted within many different economies. Contributionism is not opinionated about how the rest of the economy must function. Different approaches for exchange, money and government could be adopted within each nation or community that decides to adopt contributionism.
